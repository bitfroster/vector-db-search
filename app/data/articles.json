    "a minimum viable product mvp is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product developmenta focus on releasing an mvp means that developers potentially avoid lengthy and possibly unnecessary work instead they iterate on working versions and respond to feedback challenging and validating assumptions about a products requirements the term was coined and defined in by frank robinson and then popularized by steve blank and eric ries it may also involve carrying out market analysis beforehand the mvp is analogous to experimentation in the scientific method applied in the context of validating business hypotheses it is utilized so that prospective entrepreneurs would know whether a given business idea would actually be viable and profitable by testing the assumptions behind a product or business idea the concept can be used to validate a market need for a product and for incremental developments of an existing product as it tests a potential business model to customers to see how the market would react it is especially useful for newstartup companies who are more concerned with finding out where potential business opportunities exist rather than executing a prefabricated isolated business model description a minimum viable product has just enough core features to effectively deploy the product and no more developers typically deploy the product to a subset of possible customers such as early adopters who are thought to be more forgiving more likely to give feedback and able to grasp a product vision from an early prototype or marketing information this strategy aims to avoid building products that customers do not want and seeks to maximize information about the customer with the least money spent the technique falls under the lean startup methodology as mvps aim to test business hypotheses and validated learning is one of the five principles of the lean startup method it contrasts strongly with the traditional stealth mode method of product development where businesses make detailed business plans spanning a considerable time horizon steve blank posited that the main principle of the lean startup approach rests in the validation of the hypotheses underlying the product by asking customers if they want the product or if the product meets their needs and pivoting to another approach if the hypothesis turns out to be false this approach to validating business ideas cheaply before substantial investment saves costs and limits risk as businesses that upon experimentation turn out to be commercially unfeasible can easily be terminated it is especially important as the main cause of startup failure is the lack of market need that is many startups fail because their product isnt needed by many people and so they cannot generate enough revenue to recoup the initial investment thus it can be said that utilizing an mvp would illuminate a prospective entrepreneur on the market demand for their products for example in specialists from the university of sydney devised the rippa robot to automate farm and weed management before it was released the technical hypothesis that the robot can distinguish weeds from farm plants had already been proven but the business hypothesis that it would be a viable tool on a working farm still needed to be proved the application of the mvp method here is that the business hypothesis and only if it proves successful will further development be invested the minimum viable product is that version of a new product a team uses to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort the definitions use of the words maximum and minimum means it is not formulaic it requires judgment to figure out for any given context what mvp makes sense due to this vagueness the term mvp is commonly used either deliberately or unwittingly to refer to a much broader notion ranging from a rather prototypelike product to a fullyfledged and marketable productan mvp can be part of a strategy and process directed toward making and selling a product to customers it is a core artifact in an iterative process of idea generation prototyping presentation data collection analysis and learning one seeks to minimize the total time spent on an iteration the process is iterated until a desirable productmarket fit is obtained or until the product is deemed nonviable steve blank typically refers to minimum viable product as minimum feature set purposes test a product hypothesis with minimal resources accelerate learning reduce wasted engineering hours get the product to early customers as soon as possible find a base for other products establish a builders abilities in crafting the product required build a brand very quickly testing testing is the essence of minimum viable products as described above an mvp seeks to test out whether an idea works in market environments while using the least possible expenditure this would be beneficial as it reduces the risk of innovating so that enormous amounts of capital would not have to be sacrificed before proving that the concept does not actually work and allowing for gradual markettested expansion models such as the real options model a simple method of testing the financial viability of an idea would be discoverydriven planning which first tests the financial viability of new ventures by carefully examining the assumptions behind the idea by a reverse income statement first begin with the income you want to obtain then the costs the new invention would take and see if the required amount of revenue that must be gained for the project to work results from a minimum viable product test aim to indicate if the product should be built to begin with testing evaluates if the initial problem or goal is solved in a manner that makes it reasonable to move forward notable quotes steve blank youre selling the vision and delivering the minimum feature set to visionaries not everyone marketing releasing and assessing the impact of a minimum viable product is a market testing strategy that is used to screen product ideas soon after their generation in software development the release is facilitated by rapid application development tools and languages common to web application development the mvp differs from the conventional market testing strategy of investing time and money early to implement a product before testing it in the market it is intended to ensure that the market wants the product before large time and monetary investments are made the mvp differs from the opensource software methodology of release early release often that listens to users letting them define the features and future of the product instead the mvp starts with a product vision which is maintained throughout the product life cycle although it is adapted based on the explicit and implicit indirect measures feedback from potential future customers of the productthe mvp is a strategy that may be used as a part of blanks customer development methodology that focuses on continual product iteration and refinement based on customer feedback additionally the presentation of nonexisting products and features may be refined using webbased statistical hypothesis testing such as ab testing business model canvas the business model canvas is used to map in the major components and activities for a company starting out the minimum viable product can be designed by using selected components of the business model canvas customers customers on the business model canvas denote to whom a value proposition is considered for utilizing the minimum viable concept here would be useful to determine whether the selected customer segment actually wants that product either from questionnaires or experimental launches whichever method is chosen the key in using the mvp is to spend as little as possible while learning as much as possible thus in this case validating the market with the least possible costvalue proposition the value proposition details what does a business offer to its customers what desires it satisfies or what problems it solves in this case usage of the mvp would focus more on the technical feasibilities of the product whether such value is possible to deliver using the product as in the rippa case described earlierchannels in the business model canvas lingo channels refer to the ways by which a business delivers value to its customers mvps would thus be used here to test whether a newly proposed method of value delivery for example new channels of distribution innovations in supply chains worksrelationship as its name implies relationships refer to how a business attracts and maintains its customers by providing them with the treatment and care they expect mvps here would be used to learn if customers would better appreciate a new method of relationship building and true to the mvp concept the test would seek to learn as much as possible whilst sacrificing the least amount of brand equity reputation or costs possible emerging applications concepts from minimum viable products are applied in other aspects of startups and organizations minimum viable brand mvb using a minimum viable brand mvb concept can ensure brand hypotheses are grounded in strategic intent and market insights minimum viable cofounder finding other people to create a minimum viable product is a common challenge for new companies and startups the concept of minimum viable cofounder is based on looking for a cofounder with the following attributes trust exceptional at building or selling company commitment personally likable productivity reasonable rational realistic criticism some research has shown that early release of an mvp may hurt a company more than help when companies risk imitation by a competitor and have not established other barriers to imitation it has also indicated that negative feedback on an mvp can negatively affect a companys reputation many developers of mobile and digital products are now criticizing the mvp because customers can easily switch between competing products through platforms eg app stores also products that do not offer the expected minimum standard of quality are inferior to competitors that enter the market with a higher standard a notable limitation of the mvp is rooted in its approach that seeks out to test its ideas to the market since the businesss new product ideas can be inferred from their testing the method may be unsuited to environments where the protection of the intellectual property is limited and where products are easily imitatedthe criticism of the mvp approach has led to several new approaches eg the minimum viable experiment mve the minimum awesome product map or the simple lovable complete see also lean startup minimum marketable feature mockup pilot experiment proof of concept startup

    "junipers are coniferous trees and shrubs in the genus juniperus joonihprs of the cypress family cupressaceae depending on the taxonomy between and species of junipers are widely distributed throughout the northern hemisphere from the arctic south to tropical africa throughout parts of western central and southern asia east to eastern tibet in the old world and in the mountains of central america the highestknown juniper forest occurs at an altitude of metres ft in southeastern tibet and the northern himalayas creating one of the highest tree lines on earth description junipers vary in size and shape from tall trees metres feet tall to columnar or lowspreading shrubs with long trailing branches they are evergreen with needlelike andor scalelike leaves they can be either monoecious or dioecious the female seed cones are very distinctive with fleshy fruitlike coalescing scales which fuse together to form a berrylike structure galbulus millimetres inches long with one to unwinged hardshelled seeds in some species these berries are redbrown or orange but in most they are blue they are often aromatic and can be used as a spice the seed maturation time varies between species from to months after pollination the male cones are similar to the other cupressaceae with to scales in hardiness zones through junipers can bloom and release pollen several times each year different junipers bloom in autumn while most pollinate from early winter until late spring many junipers eg j chinensis j virginiana have two types of leaves seedlings and some twigs of older trees have needlelike leaves mm in long on mature plants the leaves are overlapping like mostly tiny scales measuring mm in when juvenile foliage occurs on mature plants it is most often found on shaded shoots with adult foliage in full sunlight leaves on fastgrowing whip shoots are often intermediate between juvenile and adult in some species eg j communis j squamata all the foliage is of the juvenile needlelike type with no scale leaves in some of these eg j communis the needles are jointed at the base while in others eg j squamata the needles merge smoothly with the stem the needle leaves of junipers are hard and sharp making the juvenile foliage very prickly to handle this can be a valuable identification feature in seedlings as the otherwise very similar juvenile foliage of cypresses cupressus chamaecyparis and other related genera are soft and not prickly junipers are gymnosperms which means they have seeds but no flowers or fruits depending on the species the seeds they produce take years to develop the impermeable coat of the seed keeps water from getting in and protects the embryo when dispersed it can also result in a long dormancy that is usually broken by physically damaging the seed coat dispersal can occur from being swallowed whole by frugivores and mammals the resistance of the seed coat allows it to be passed down through the digestive system without being destroyed along the way these seeds last a long time as they can be dispersed long distances over the course of a few years classification sections the genus has been divided into sections in somewhat different ways a system based on molecular phylogenetic data from and earlier used three sections section caryocedrus species with large blue woody seeded cones native to the mediterranean section

environments the junipers from lahaul valley can be found in dry rocky locations planted in stony soils grazing animals and the villagers are rapidly using up these plants there are several important features of the leaves and wood of this plant that cause villagers to cut down these trees and make use of them additionally the western juniper plants a particular species in the juniper genus are found in woodlands where there are large open spaces junipers are known to encompass open areas so that they have more exposure to rainfall decreases in fires and a lack of livestock grazing are the two major causes of western juniper takeover this invasion of junipers is driving changes in the environment for instance the ecosystem for other species previously living in the environment and farm animals has been compromised when junipers increase in population there is a decrease in woody species like mountain big sagebrush and aspen among the juniper trees themselves there is increased competition which results in a decrease in berry production herbaceous cover decreases and junipers are often mistaken for weeds as a result several farmers have thinned the juniper trees or removed them completely however this reduction did not result in any significant difference on wildlife survival some small mammals found it advantageous to have thinner juniper trees while cutting down the entire tree was not favorablesome junipers are susceptible to gymnosporangium rust disease and can be a serious problem for those people growing apple trees an alternate host of the disease juniper is the exclusive food plant of the larvae of some moths and butterflies including bucculatrix inusitata juniper carpet chionodes electella chionodes viduella juniper pug and pine beauty those of the tortrix moth cydia duplicana feed on the bark around injuries or canker cultivation junipers are among the most popular conifers to be cultivated as ornamental subjects for parks and gardens they have been bred over many years to produce a wide range of forms in terms of colour shape and size they include some of the dwarfest miniature cultivars they are also used for bonsai some species found in cultivation include toxicity in drier areas juniper pollen easily becomes airborne and can be inhaled into the lungs this pollen can also irritate the skin and cause contact dermatitis crossallergenic reactions are common between juniper pollen and the pollen of all species of cypressmonoecious juniper plants are highly allergenic with an ogren plant allergy scale opals rating of out of completely male juniper plants have an opals rating of and release abundant amounts of pollen conversely allfemale juniper plants have an opals rating of and are considered allergyfighting uses ethnic and herbal use most species of juniper are flexible and have a high compression strengthtoweight ratio this has made the wood a traditional choice for the construction of hunting bows among some of the native american cultures in the great basin region these bow staves are typically backed with sinew to provide tension strength that the wood may lackancient mesopotamians believed that juniper oil could be used to ward off the evil eyeembalming vessels in the burial chambers from a th dynasty embalming workshop at saqqara have shown the usage of juniper oiltarsome indigenous peoples of the americas use juniper in traditional medicine for instance the dineh navajo who use it for diabetes juniper ash has also been historically consumed as a source of calcium by the navajo peoplejuniper is traditionally used in scottish folkloric and gaelic polytheist saining rites such as those performed at hogmanay new year where the smoke of burning juniper accompanied by traditional prayers and other customary rites is used to cleanse bless and protect the household and its inhabitantslocal people in lahaul valley present juniper leaves to their deities as a folk tradition it is also useful as a folk remedy for pains and aches as well as epilepsy and asthma they are reported to collect large amounts of juniper leaves and wood for building and religious purposes general use juniper

    "york is a cathedral city in north yorkshire england with roman origins sited at the confluence of the rivers ouse and foss it is the county town of yorkshire the city has many historic buildings and other structures such as a minster castle and city walls it is the largest settlement and the administrative centre of the wider city of york district through the title of duke of york it is the namesake of new york citythe city was founded under the name of eboracum in ad it then became the capital of the roman province of britannia inferior and later of the kingdoms of deira northumbria and scandinavian york in the middle ages it became the northern england ecclesiastical provinces centre and grew as a wooltrading centre in the th century it became a major railway network hub and confectionery manufacturing centre in the second world war part of the baedeker blitz bombed the city although less targeted during the war than other more industrialised northern cities several historic buildings were gutted and restoration took place up until the sthe city is one of in england to have a lord mayor and one of three to have the right honourable title affixed the others being londons and bristols historic governance of the city was as a county corporate not included in the countys riding system the city has since been covered by a municipal borough county borough and since a nonmetropolitan district the city of york which also includes surrounding villages and rural areas and the town of haxby the current districts local council is responsible for providing all local services and facilities throughout this area yorks city proper area had a population of at the uk census the wider district had a population of according to census data the wider district has a population of a increase compared to the census toponymy the name york old norse jrvk is derived from the brittonic name eburkon latinised as eboracum or eburacum a combination of eburos yew tree compare with welsh efwr and breton evor both meaning alder buckthorn and old irish ibar irish iobhar iubhar and ir and scottish gaelic iubhar and a suffix of appurtenance kon meaning belonging to or place of compare welsh og put together these old words meant place of the yew trees in welsh efrog in old irish iubrach in irish gaelic irach and in scottish gaelic ibhrach the city is called eabhraig in scottish gaelic and eabhrac in irishnames derived from the latin word eboracum a proposed alternative meaning is the settlement of a man named eburos a celtic personal name spelled variously in different documents as e eburus and eburius when combined with the celtic possessive suffix kon the word could be used to denote the property of a man with this namethe name eboracum became the anglian eoforwic in the th century a compound of eofor from the old name and wic meaning village probably by conflation of the element ebor with a germanic root eburaz boar by the th century the old english for boar had become eofor when the danish army conquered the city in it was renamed jrvkthe old french and norman name of the city following the norman conquest was recorded as everwic modern norman vroui in works such as waces roman de rou and as euruic in the domesday book jrvk meanwhile gradually reduced to york in the centuries after the conquest moving from the middle english yerk in the th century through yourke in the th century to yarke in the th century the form york was first recorded in the th century many company and place names such as the ebor race meeting refer to the latinised brittonic roman namethe thcentury chronicler geoffrey of monmouth in his fictional account of the prehistoric kings of britain historia regum britanniae suggests the name derives from that of a preroman city founded by the legendary king ebraucusthe archbishop of york uses ebor as his surname in his signature history early history archaeological evidence suggests that mesolithic people settled in the region of york between and bc although it is not known whether their settlements were permanent or temporary by the time of the roman conquest of britain the area was occupied by a tribe known to the romans as the brigantes the brigantian tribal area initially became a roman client state but later its leaders became more hostile and the roman ninth legion was sent north of the humber into brigantian territorythe city was founded in ad when the ninth legion conquered the brigantes and constructed a wooden military fortress on flat ground above the river ouse close to its confluence with the river foss the fortress whose walls were rebuilt in stone by the vi legion based there subsequent to the ix legion covered an area of acres ha and was inhabited by legionary soldiers the site of the principia hq of the fortress lies under the foundations of york minster and excavations in the undercroft have revealed part of the roman structure and columns the emperors hadrian septimius severus and constantius i all held court in york during their various campaigns during his stay ad the emperor severus proclaimed york capital of the province of britannia inferior and it is likely that it was he who granted york the privileges of a colonia or city constantius i died in ad during his stay in york and his son constantine the great was proclaimed emperor by the troops based in the fortress in ad a bishop from york attended the council at arles to represent christians from the provincewhile the roman colonia and fortress were on high ground by ad the town was victim to occasional flooding from the rivers ouse and foss and the population reduced york declined in the postroman era and was taken and settled by the angles in the th centuryreclamation of parts of the town was initiated in the th century under king edwin of northumbria and york became his chief city the first wooden minster church was built in york for the baptism of edwin in according to the venerable bede edwin ordered the small wooden church be rebuilt in stone however he was killed in and the task of completing the stone minster fell to his successor oswald in the following century alcuin of york came to the cathedral school of york he had a long career as a teacher and scholar first at the school at york now known as st peters school founded in ad and later as charlemagnes leading advisor on ecclesiastical and educational affairsin northumbria was in the midst of internecine struggles when the vikings raided and captured york as a thriving anglosaxon metropolis and prosperous economic hub york was a clear target for the vikings led by ivar the boneless and halfdan scandinavian forces attacked the town on all saints day launching the assault on a holy day proved an effective tactical move most of yorks leaders were in the cathedral leaving the town vulnerable to attack and unprepared for battle after it was conquered the city was renamed from the saxon eoforwic to jorvik it became the capital of viking territory in britain and at its peak boasted more than inhabitants this was a population second only to london within great britain jorvik proved an important economic and trade centre for the vikings norse coinage was created at the jorvik mint while archaeologists have found evidence of a variety of craft workshops around the towns central coppergate area these demonstrate that textile production metalwork carving glasswork and jewellerymaking were all practised in jorvik materials from as far afield as the persian gulf have also been discovered suggesting that the town was part of an international trading network under viking rule the city became a major river port part of the extensive viking trading routes throughout northern europe the last ruler of an independent jrvk eric bloodaxe was driven from the city in ad by king eadred in his successful attempt to complete the unification of england after the conquest in two years after the norman conquest of england the people of york rebelled initially they succeeded but upon the arrival of william the conqueror the rebellion was put down william at once built a wooden fortress on a motte in after another rebellion the king built another timbered castle across the river ouse these were destroyed in and rebuilt by william about the time of his ravaging northumbria in what is called the harrying of the north where he destroyed everything from york to durham the remains of the rebuilt castles now in stone are visible on either side of the river ousethe first stone minster church was badly damaged by fire in the uprising and the normans built a minster on a new site around the year archbishop thomas started building the cathedral that in time became the current minster in the th century york started to prosper in york castle was the site of an infamous massacre of its jewish inhabitants in which at least were murdered although some authorities put the figure as high as the city through its location on the river ouse and its proximity to the great north road became a major trading centre king john granted the citys first charter in confirming trading rights in england and europe during the later middle ages york merchants imported wine from france cloth wax canvas and oats from the low countries timber and furs from the baltic and exported grain to gascony and grain and wool to the low countriesyork became a major cloth manufacturing and trading centre edward i further stimulated the citys economy by using the city as a base for his war in scotland the city was the location of significant unrest during the socalled peasants revolt in the city acquired an increasing degree of autonomy from central government including the privileges granted by a charter of richard ii in th to th centuries the city underwent a period of economic decline during tudor times under king henry viii the dissolution of the monasteries saw the end of yorks many monastic houses including several orders of friars the hospitals of st nicholas and of st leonard the largest such institution in the north of england this led to the pilgrimage of grace an uprising of northern catholics in yorkshire and lincolnshire opposed to religious reform henry viii restored his authority by establishing the council of the north in york in the dissolved st marys abbey the city became a trading and service centre during this periodanne of denmark came to york with her children prince henry and princess elizabeth on june the mayor gave her a tour and offered her spiced wine but she preferred beer guy fawkes who was born and educated in york was a member of a group of roman catholic restorationists that planned the gunpowder plot its aim was to displace protestant rule by blowing up the houses of parliament while king james i the entire protestant and even most of the catholic aristocracy and nobility were inside in during the civil war the parliamentarians besieged york and many medieval houses outside the city walls were lost the barbican at walmgate bar was undermined and explosives laid but the plot was discovered on the arrival of prince rupert with an army of men the siege was lifted the parliamentarians retreated some miles km from york with rupert in pursuit before turning on his army and soundly defeating it at the battle of marston moor of ruperts troops were killed and captured the siege was renewed and the city surrendered to sir thomas fairfax on july following the restoration of the monarchy in and the removal of the garrison from york in the city was dominated by the gentry and merchants although the clergy were still important competition from leeds and hull together with silting of the river ouse resulted in york losing its preeminent position as a trading centre but its role as the social and cultural centre for wealthy northerners was rising yorks many elegant townhouses such as the lord mayors mansion house and fairfax house date from this period as do the assembly rooms the theatre royal and the racecourse modern history the railway promoter george hudson was responsible for bringing the railway to york in although hudsons career as a railway entrepreneur ended in disgrace and bankruptcy his promotion of york over leeds and of his own railway company the york and north midland railway helped establish york as a major railway centre by the late th centurythe introduction of the railways established engineering in the city at the turn of the th century the railway accommodated the headquarters and works of the north eastern railway which employed more than people the railway was instrumental in the expansion of rowntrees cocoa works it was founded in by henry isaac rowntree who was joined in by his brother the philanthropist joseph another chocolate manufacturer terrys of york was a major employer by the railways and confectionery had become the citys two major industries york was a centre of early photography as described by hugh murray in his book photographs and photographers of york the early years photographers who had studios in york included william hayes william pumphrey and augustus mahalski who operated on davygate and low petergate in the th century having come to england as a refugee after serving as a polish lancer in the austrohungarian warin the city was bombed during the second world war part of the baedeker blitz by the german luftwaffe and people were killed and hundreds injured buildings damaged in the raid included the railway station rowntrees factory poppleton road primary school st martinlegrand church the bar convent and the guildhall which was left in total disrepair until with the emergence of tourism the historic core of york became one of the citys major assets and in it was designated a conservation area the existing tourist attractions were supplemented by the establishment of the national railway museum in york in the jorvik viking centre in and the york dungeon in the opening of the university of york in added to the prosperity of the city in march yorks chocolate story openedyork was voted european

air from above the surface when the wearers head is facing downwards in the water with the mouth and the nose submerged it may be either separate or integrated into a swimming or diving mask the integrated version is only suitable for surface snorkeling while the separate device may also be used for underwater activities such as spearfishing freediving finswimming underwater hockey underwater rugby and for surface breathing with scuba equipment a swimmers snorkel is a tube bent into a shape often resembling the letter l or j fitted with a mouthpiece at the lower end and constructed of light metal rubber or plastic the snorkel may come with a rubber loop or a plastic clip enabling the snorkel to be attached to the outside of the head strap of the diving mask although the snorkel may also be secured by tucking the tube between the mask strap and the head this alternative strategy can lead to physical discomfort mask leakage or even snorkel losssnorkels constitute respiratory dead space when the user takes in a fresh breath some of the previously exhaled air which remains in the snorkel is inhaled again reducing the amount of fresh air in the inhaled volume and increasing the risk of a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood which can result in hypercapnia the greater the volume of the tube and the smaller the tidal volume of breathing the more this problem is exacerbated a smaller diameter tube reduces the dead volume but also increases resistance to airflow and so increases the work of breathing including the internal volume of the mask in the breathing circuit greatly expands the dead space occasional exhalation through the nose while snorkeling with a separate snorkel will slightly reduce the buildup of carbon dioxide and may help in keeping the mask clear of water but in cold water it will increase fogging to some extent the effect of dead space can be counteracted by breathing more deeply and slowly as this reduces the dead space ratio and work of breathing snorkels come in two orientations frontmounted and sidemounted the first snorkel to be patented in was frontmounted worn with the tube over the front of the face and secured with a bracket to the diving mask frontmounted snorkels proved popular in european snorkeling until the late s when sidemounted snorkels came into the ascendancy frontmounted snorkels experienced a comeback a decade later as a piece of competitive swimming equipment to be used in pool workouts and in finswimming races where they outperform sidemounted snorkels in streamlining plain snorkel a plain snorkel consists essentially of a tube with a mouthpiece to be inserted between the lips the barrel is the hollow tube leading from the supply end at the top of the snorkel to the mouthpiece at the bottom the barrel is made of a relatively rigid material such as plastic light metal or hard rubber the bore is the interior chamber of the barrel bore length diameter and bends all affect breathing resistance the top of the barrel may be open to the elements or fitted with a valve designed to shut off the air supply from the atmosphere when the top is submerged there may be a high visibility band around the top to alert other water users of the snorkelers presence the simplest way of attaching the snorkel to the head is to slip the top of the barrel between the mask strap and the head this may cause the mask to leak however and alternative means of attachment of the barrel to the head include threading the mask strap a molded on the barrel using a figure rubber snorkel keeper pulled down over the barrel or a rotatable plastic snorkel keeper clipped to the barrel the mouthpiece helps to keep the snorkel in the mouth it is made of soft and flexible material originally natural rubber and more recently silicone or pvc the commonest of the multiple designs available features a slightly concave flange with two lugs to be gripped between the teeth the tighter the teeth grip the mouthpiece lugs the smaller the air gap between the teeth and the harder it will be to breathe a tight grip with the teeth can also cause jaw fatigue and pain fullface snorkel mask an integrated snorkel consists essentially of a tube topped with a shutoff valve and opening at the bottom into the interior of a diving mask integrated snorkels must be fitted with valves to shut off the snorkels air inlet when submerged water will otherwise pour into the opening at the top and flood the interior of the mask snorkels are attached to sockets on the top or the sides of the mask newgeneration snorkel masks are fullface masks covering the eyes the nose and the mouth they enable surface snorkelers to breathe nasally or orally and may be a workaround in the case of surface snorkelers who gag in response to the presence of standard snorkel mouthpieces in their mouths some early snorkel masks are fullface masks covering the eyes nose and mouth while others exclude the mouth covering the eyes and the nose only the s us divers marino hybrid comprised a single snorkel mask with eye and nose coverage and a separate snorkel for the mouthfullface snorkel masks use an integral snorkel with separate channels for intake and exhaled gases theoretically ensuring the user is always breathing untainted fresh air whatever the respiratory effort they come with a builtin dry top snorkel system in addition to a standard ball float system that stops the water from entering the tube when submerged fullface masks are designed in such a way that even if a small amount of water does get into the snorkel it will be channeled away from the face and into the chin area of the mask a special valve located on the bottom of the chin allows to drain the water out the main problem is that it must fit the whole face well enough to make a reliable seal and since no two faces are the same shape it may not seal adequately on any specific user in the event of accidental flooding the whole mask must be removed to continue breathing unless the snorkeler is able to equalize without pinching their nose it can only be used on or within several feet of the surface since the mask covers the nose with a rigid plastic structure which makes it impossible to pinch the nose if needed to equalize pressure at greater depth trained scuba divers are likely to avoid such devices however snorkel masks are a boon for those with medical conditions that preclude taking part in scuba divingas a result of a short period with an unusually high number of snorkeling deaths in hawaii there is some suspicion that the design of the masks can result in buildup of excess co it is far from certain that the masks are at fault but the state of hawaii has begun to track the equipment being used in cases of snorkeling fatalities besides the possibility that the masks or at least some brands of the mask are a cause other theories include the possibility that the masks make snorkeling accessible to people who have difficulty with traditional snorkeling equipment that ease of access may result in more snorkelers who lack experience or have underlying medical conditions possibly exacerbating problems that are unrelated to the type of equipment being usedduring the current coronavirus pandemic related shortages fullface snorkel masks have been adapted to create oxygen dispensing emergency respiratory masks by deploying d printing and carrying out minimal modifications to the original mask italian healthcare legislation requires patients to sign a declaration of acceptance of use of an uncertified biomedical device when they are given the modified snorkel mask for respiratory support interventions in the countrys hospitals frances main sportwear and snorkel masks producer decathlon has discontinued its sale of snorkel masks redirecting them instead toward medical staff patients and d printer operations retail sales have now resumed diving mask snorkelers normally wear the same kind of mask as those worn by scuba divers by creating an airspace the mask enables the snorkeler to see clearly underwater all scuba diving masks consist of the lenses also known as a faceplate a soft rubber skirt which encloses the nose and seals against the face and a head strap to hold it in place there are different styles and shapes these range from oval shaped models to lower internal volume masks and may be made from different materials common choices are silicone and rubber a snorkeler who remains at the surface can use swimmers goggles which do not enclose the nose swimfins swimfins fins or flippers are finlike accessories worn on the feet and usually made from rubber or plastic to aid movement through the water in water sports activities swimfins help the wearer to move through water more efficiently as human feet are too small and inappropriately shaped to provide much thrust especially when the wearer is carrying equipment that increases hydrodynamic drag very long fins and monofins used by freedivers as a means of underwater propulsion do not require highfrequency leg movement this improves efficiency and helps to minimize oxygen consumption short stiffbladed fins are effective for short bursts of acceleration and maneuvering openbacked fins allow the wearer to wear them over the top of wetsuit socks or boots which can be useful in cooler water exposure protection a wetsuit is a garment usually made of foamed neoprene with a knit fabric facing which is worn by people engaged in water sports and other activities in or on water primarily providing thermal insulation but also buoyancy and protection from abrasion ultraviolet exposure and stings from marine organisms the insulation properties depend on bubbles of gas enclosed within the material which reduce its ability to conduct heat the bubbles also give the wetsuit a low density providing buoyancy in water the thickness fit and coverage of the suit are important factors for insulation wetsuit protection can be extended to cover the head feet and hands with the addition of a hood gloves socks or boots back in the s and early s snorkeling was often undertaken wearing a onepiece or twopiece thinrubber valveless dry suit in the new millennium the use of drysuits in snorkelling is seeing something of a resurgence thanks to the growing popularity of wilderness swimming or wildswimming in seas lakes and riversdive skins are used when diving in water temperatures above c f they are usually one piece full length garments made from spandex or lycra and provide little thermal protection but do protect the skin from jellyfish stings abrasion and sunburn this kind of suit is also known as a stinger suit some divers wear a dive skin under a wetsuit which allows easier donning and for those who experience skin problems from neoprene provides additional comforta rash guard also known as rash vest or rashie is an athletic shirt made of spandex and nylon or polyester the name rash guard reflects the fact that the shirt protects the wearer against rashes caused by abrasion or by sunburn from extended exposure to the sun these shirts can be worn by themselves or under a wetsuit a rash guard by itself is used for light coverage in warm to extreme summer temperatures for several watersports including snorkeling there are also lower body rash guards which are similar to compression shorts to be worn under the surfers boardshorts weight belt weight belts are the most common weighting system currently in use for snorkeling they are generally made of tough nylon webbing but other materials such as rubber can be used weight belts for snorkeling are generally fitted with a quick release buckle to allow the dumping of weight rapidly in an emergency the most common design of weight used with a belt is rectangular lead blocks with two slots in them threaded onto the belt these blocks can be coated in plastic which increases corrosion resistance the plastic coated weights may be marketed as being less abrasive to wetsuits the weights may be constrained from sliding along the webbing by metal or plastic belt sliders another popular style has a single slot through which the belt can be threaded these are sometimes locked in position by squeezing the weight to grip the webbing but this makes them difficult to remove when less weight is needed there are also weight designs which may be added to the belt by clipping on when needed the amount of weight needed depends mainly on the buoyancy of the wet suit snorkeling vest an inflatable personal buoyancy aid designed for surface swimming applications in shape often like a horsecollar buoyancy compensator or airline life jacket but only with oral inflation or a co cartridge for emergencies operation the simplest type of snorkel is a plain tube that is allowed to flood when underwater the snorkeler expels water from the snorkel either with a sharp exhalation on return to the surface blast clearing or by tilting the head back shortly before reaching the surface and exhaling until reaching or breaking the surface displacement method and facing forward or down again before inhaling the next breath the displacement method expels water by filling the snorkel with air it is a technique that takes practice but clears the snorkel with less effort but only works when surfacing clearing splash water while at the surface requires blast clearingexperienced users tend to develop a surface breathing style which minimizes work of breathing carbon dioxide buildup and risk of water inspiration while optimizing water removal this involves a sharp puff in the early stage of exhalation which is effective for clearing the tube of remaining water and a fairly large but comfortable exhaled volume mostly fairly slowly for low work of breathing followed by an immediate slow inhalation which reduces entrapment of any residual water to a comfortable but relatively large inhaled volume repeated without delay elastic recoil is used to assist with the initial puff which can be made sharper by controlling the start of exhalation with the tongue this technique is most applicable to relaxed cruising on the surface racing finswimmers may use a different technique as they need a far greater level of ventilation when working hard some snorkels have a sump at the lowest point to allow a small volume of water to remain in the snorkel without being inhaled when the snorkeler breathes some also have a nonreturn valve in the sump to drain water in the tube when the diver exhales the water is pushed out through the valve when the tube is blocked by water and the exhalation pressure exceeds the water pressure on the outside of the valve this is almost exactly the mechanism of blast clearing which does not require the valve but the pressure required is marginally less and effective blast clearing requires a higher flow rate the full face mask has a double airflow valve which allows breathing through the nose in addition to the mouth a few models of snorkel have floatoperated valves attached to the top end of the tube to keep water out when a wave passes but these cause problems when diving as the snorkel must then be equalized during descent using part of the divers inhaled air supply some recent designs have a splash deflector on the top end that reduces entry of any water that splashes over the top end of the tube thereby keeping it relatively free from waterfinswimmers do not normally use snorkels with a sump valve as they learn to blast clear the tube on most if not all exhalations which keeps the water content in the tube to a minimum as the tube can be shaped for lower work of breathing and elimination of water traps allowing greater speed and lowering the stress of eventual swallowing of small quantities of water which would impede their competition performancea common problem with all mechanical clearing mechanisms is their tendency to fail if infrequently used or if stored for long periods or through environmental fouling or owing to lack of maintenance many also either slightly increase the flow resistance of the snorkel or provide a small water trap which retains a little water in the tube after clearingmodern designs use silicone rubber in the mouthpiece and oneway clearing and float valves due to its resistance to degradation and its long service life natural rubber was formerly used but slowly oxidizes and breaks down due to ultraviolet light exposure from the sun it eventually loses its flexibility becomes brittle and cracks which can cause clearing valves to stick in the open or closed position and float valves to leak due to a failure of the valve seat to seal in even older designs some snorkels were made with small ping pong balls in a cage mounted to the open end of the tube to prevent water ingress these are no longer sold or recommended because they are unreliable and considered hazardous similarly diving masks with a builtin snorkel are considered unsafe by scuba diving organizations such as padi bsac because they can engender a false sense of security and can be difficult to clear if flooded a snorkel may be either separate or integrated into a swim or dive mask usage of the term snorkel in this section excludes devices integrated with and opening into swimmers or divers masks a separate snorkel typically comprises a tube for breathing and a means of attaching the tube to the head of the wearer the tube has an opening at the top and a mouthpiece at the bottom some tubes are topped with a valve to prevent water from entering the tube when it is submerged the total length inner diameter andor inner volume of a snorkel tube are matters of utmost importance because they affect the users ability to breathe normally while swimming or floating head downwards on the surface of the water these dimensions also have implications for the users ability to blow residual water out of the tube when surfacing an overlong snorkel tube may cause breathing resistance while an overwide tube may prove hard to clear of water a highvolume tube is liable to encourage a buildup of stale air including exhaled carbon dioxide because it constitutes respiratory dead space practice of snorkeling snorkeling is an activity in its own right as well as an adjunct to other activities such as breathhold diving spearfishing and scuba diving and several competitive underwater sports such as underwater hockey and finswimming in all cases the use of a snorkel facilitates breathing while swimming at the surface and observing what is going on under the water being noncompetitive snorkeling is considered more a leisure activity than a sport snorkeling requires no special training only the very basic swimming abilities and being able to breathe through the snorkel some organizations such as the british subaqua club recommend that for snorkeling safety one should not snorkel alone but rather with a buddy a guide or a tour group snorkelers may progress to freediving or recreational scuba diving which should be preceded by at least some training from a dive instructor or experienced freediver underwater photography underwater photography has grown in popularity since the early s as waterproof cameras became affordable to recreational users many snorkelers now carry a waterproof camera with them while they snorkel and may record photographs or video clips and later share them on social media platforms or post them to other websites this mass of documentation has enormous scientific potential as millions of tourists are able to cover greater areas than professional scientists whose fieldstudy time is limited various citizen science programs have emerged to realize this potential thus underwater photographs of natural subjects become database records of geolocated and timestamped species observations the observed species may be identified by the contributor or by other website users or team members depending on the platform various protocols for organization and selfdirected study for snorkelers interested in natural science also exist at runion island these approaches have resulted in many new records and even the discovery of new speciesmany underwater photographs taken by snorkelers can be seen and used by scientists via the website inaturalistorg there website users identify and verify the subjects of the photographs this creates valuable data for the use of professional scientists and environmental managers around the world safety some commercial snorkeling organizations require snorkelers at their venue to wear an inflatable vest similar to a personal flotation device they are usually bright yellow or orange and have a device that allows users to inflate or deflate the device to adjust their buoyancy however these devices hinder and prevent a snorkeler from free diving to any depth especially in cooler water a wetsuit of appropriate thickness and coverage may be worn wetsuits do provide some buoyancy without as much resistance to submersion in the tropics snorkelers especially those with pale skin often wear a rashguard or a shirt andor board shorts in order to help protect the skin of the back and upper legs against sunburnthe greatest danger to snorkelers are inshore and leisure craft such as jet skis speed boats and the like a snorkeler is often submerged in the water with only the tube visible above the surface since these craft can ply the same areas snorkelers visit the chance for accidental collisions exists sailboats and sailboards are a particular hazard as their quiet propulsion systems may not alert the snorkeler of their presence a snorkeler may surface underneath a vessel andor be struck by it few locations demarcate small craft areas from snorkeling areas unlike that done for regular beachbathers with areas marked by buoys snorkelers may therefore choose to wear bright or highly reflective colorsoutfits andor to tow dive flags on floats to enable easy spotting by boaters and otherssnorkelers backs ankles and rear of their thighs can be exposed to the sun for extended periods and can burn badly even if slightly submerged without being noticed in time wearing appropriate covering such as a rash guard with spf in warmer waters a tshirt a wetsuit and especially waterproof sunblock will mitigate this riskdehydration is another concern hydrating well before entering the water is highly recommended especially if one intends to snorkel for several hours proper hydration also prevents cramps snorkelers who hyperventilate to extend subsurface time can experience hypocapnia if they hyperventilate prior to submerging this can in turn lead to shallow water blackout snorkeling with a buddy and remaining aware of the buddys condition at all times may help avoid these difficultieswhen snorkeling on or near coral reefs care must be exercised to avoid contact with the delicate and sometimes sharp or stinging coral and its venomous inhabitants usually by wearing protective gloves and being careful of ones environment coral scrapes and cuts often require specialized first aid treatment and potentially emergency medical treatment to avoid infection booties and surf shoes are especially useful as they allow trekking over reefs exposed by low tide to access dropoffs or deeper waters of the outer reefpractices which are however considered ecologically irresponsiblecontact with coral should always be avoided because even boulder corals are fragile fin contact is a wellknown cause of coral reef degradation another safety concern is interaction and contact with the marine life during encounters while seals and sea turtles can seem harmless and docile they can become alarmed if approached or feel threatened some creatures like moray eels can hide in coral crevices and holes and may bite fingers in response to prodding for these reasons snorkeling websites often recommend an observe but dont touch etiquette when snorkeling snorkeling locations snorkeling is possible in almost any body of water but snorkelers are more likely to be found in locations where the water is warm waves are small and there is something particularly interesting to see near the surface such as a reef or a shipwreckgenerally shallow reefs ranging from to meters to ft are favored by snorkelers enough water cover to swim over the top without kicking the bottom is needed but isolated shallow structure can be approached from the sides deeper reefs can also be explored but repeated breathholding to dive to those depths limits the number of practitioners and raises the bar on the required fitness and skill level risk increases with increased depth and duration of the breathhold excursions from the surfacesome less commonly snorkeled bodies of water include sinkholes lakes and rivers snorkeling locations are often listed and described in

    "a boiler is a closed vessel in which fluid generally water is heated the fluid does not necessarily boil the heated or vaporized fluid exits the boiler for use in various processes or heating applications including water heating central heating boilerbased power generation cooking and sanitation heat sources in a fossil fuel power plant using a steam cycle for power generation the primary heat source will be combustion of coal oil or natural gas in some cases byproduct fuel such as the carbon monoxide rich offgasses of a coke battery can be burned to heat a boiler biofuels such as bagasse where economically available can also be used in a nuclear power plant boilers called steam generators are heated by the heat produced by nuclear fission where a large volume of hot gas is available from some process a heat recovery steam generator or recovery boiler can use the heat to produce steam with little or no extra fuel consumed such a configuration is common in a combined cycle power plant where a gas turbine and a steam boiler are used in all cases the combustion product waste gases are separate from the working fluid of the steam cycle making these systems examples of external combustion engines materials the pressure vessel of a boiler is usually made of steel or alloy steel or historically of wrought iron stainless steel especially of the austenitic types is not used in wetted parts of boilers due to corrosion and stress corrosion cracking however ferritic stainless steel is often used in superheater sections that will not be exposed to boiling water and electricallyheated stainless steel shell boilers are allowed under the european pressure equipment directive for production of steam for sterilizers and disinfectorsin live steam models copper or brass is often used because it is more easily fabricated in smaller size boilers historically copper was often used for fireboxes particularly for steam locomotives because of its better formability and higher thermal conductivity however in more recent times the high price of copper often makes this an uneconomic choice and cheaper substitutes such as steel are used insteadfor much of the victorian age of steam the only material used for boilermaking was the highest grade of wrought iron with assembly by riveting this iron was often obtained from specialist ironworks such as those in the cleator moor uk area noted for the high quality of their rolled plate which was especially suitable for use in critical applications such as highpressure boilers in the th century design practice moved towards the use of steel with welded construction which is stronger and cheaper and can be fabricated more quickly and with less labour wrought iron boilers corrode far more slowly than their modernday steel counterparts and are less susceptible to localized pitting and stresscorrosion that makes the longevity of older wroughtiron boilers far superior to that of welded steel boilerscast iron may be used for the heating vessel of domestic water heaters although such heaters are usually termed boilers in some countries their purpose is usually to produce hot water not steam and so they run at low pressure and try to avoid boiling the brittleness of cast iron makes it impractical for highpressure steam boilers energy the source of heat for a boiler is combustion of any of several fuels such as wood coal oil or natural gas electric steam boilers use resistance or immersiontype heating elements nuclear fission is also used as a heat source for generating steam either directly

classified into the following configurations pot boiler or haycock boilerhaystack boiler a primitive kettle where a fire heats a partially filled water container from below th century haycock boilers generally produced and stored large volumes of very lowpressure steam often hardly above that of the atmosphere these could burn wood or most often coal efficiency was very low flued boiler with one or two large fluesan early type or forerunner of firetube boiler firetube boiler here water partially fills a boiler barrel with a small volume left above to accommodate the steam steam space this is the type of boiler used in nearly all steam locomotives the heat source is inside a furnace or firebox that has to be kept permanently surrounded by the water in order to maintain the temperature of the heating surface below the boiling point the furnace can be situated at one end of a firetube which lengthens the path of the hot gases thus augmenting the heating surface which can be further increased by making the gases reverse direction through a second parallel tube or a bundle of multiple tubes twopass or return flue boiler alternatively the gases may be taken along the sides and then beneath the boiler through flues pass boiler in case of a locomotivetype boiler a boiler barrel extends from the firebox and the hot gases pass through a bundle of fire tubes inside the barrel which greatly increases the heating surface compared to a single tube and further improves heat transfer firetube boilers usually have a comparatively low rate of steam production but high steam storage capacity firetube boilers mostly burn solid fuels but are readily adaptable to those of the liquid or gas variety firetube boilers may also be referred to as scotchmarine or marine type boilers watertube boiler in this type tubes filled with water are arranged inside a furnace in a number of possible configurations often the water tubes connect large drums the lower ones containing water and the upper ones steam and water in other cases such as a monotube boiler water is circulated by a pump through a succession of coils this type generally gives high steam production rates but less storage capacity than the above water tube boilers can be designed to exploit any heat source and are generally preferred in highpressure applications since the highpressure watersteam is contained within small diameter pipes which can withstand the pressure with a thinner wall these boilers are commonly constructed in place roughly square in shape and can be multiple stories tall flash boiler a flash boiler is a specialized type of watertube boiler in which tubes are close together and water is pumped through them a flash boiler differs from the type of monotube steam generator in which the tube is permanently filled with water in a flash boiler the tube is kept so hot that the water feed is quickly flashed into steam and superheated flash boilers had some use in automobiles in the th century and this use continued into the early th centuryfiretube boiler with watertube firebox sometimes the two above types have been combined in the following manner the firebox contains an assembly of water tubes called thermic siphons the gases then pass through a conventional firetube boiler watertube fireboxes were installed in many hungarian locomotives but have met with little success in other countries sectional boiler in a cast iron sectional boiler sometimes called a pork chop boiler the water is contained inside cast iron sections these sections are assembled on site to create the finished boiler safety to define and secure boilers safely some professional specialized organizations such as the american society of mechanical engineers asme develop standards and regulation codes for instance the asme boiler and pressure vessel code is a standard providing a wide range of rules and directives to ensure compliance of the boilers and other pressure vessels with safety security and design standardshistorically boilers were a source of many serious injuries and property destruction due to poorly understood engineering principles thin and brittle metal shells can rupture while poorly welded or riveted seams could open up leading to a violent eruption of the pressurized steam when water is converted to steam it expands to over times its original volume and travels down steam pipes at over kilometres per hour mph because of this steam is an efficient method of moving energy and heat around a site from a central boiler house to where it is needed but without the right boiler feedwater treatment a steamraising plant will suffer from scale formation and corrosion at best this increases energy costs and can lead to poor quality steam reduced efficiency shorter plant life and unreliable operation at worst it can lead to catastrophic failure and loss of life collapsed or dislodged boiler tubes can also spray scaldinghot steam and smoke out of the air intake and firing chute injuring the firemen who load the coal into the fire chamber extremely large boilers providing hundreds of horsepower to operate factories can potentially demolish entire buildingsa boiler that has a loss of feed water and is permitted to boil dry can be extremely dangerous if feed water is then sent into the empty boiler the small cascade of incoming water instantly boils on contact with the superheated metal shell and leads to a violent explosion that cannot be controlled even by safety steam valves draining of the boiler can also happen if a leak occurs in the steam supply lines that is larger than the makeup water supply could replace the hartford loop was invented in by the hartford steam boiler inspection and insurance company as a method to help prevent this condition from occurring and thereby reduce their insurance claims superheated steam boiler when water is boiled the result is saturated steam also referred to as wet steam saturated steam while mostly consisting of water vapor carries some unevaporated water in the form of droplets saturated steam is useful for many purposes such as cooking heating and sanitation but is not desirable when steam is expected to convey energy to machinery such as a ships propulsion system or the motion of a steam locomotive this is because unavoidable temperature andor pressure loss that occurs as steam travels from the boiler to the machinery will cause some condensation resulting in liquid water being carried into the machinery the water entrained in the steam may damage turbine blades or in the case of a reciprocating steam engine may cause serious mechanical damage due to hydrostatic lock superheated steam boilers evaporate the water and then further heat the steam in a superheater causing the discharged steam temperature to be substantially above the boiling temperature at the boilers operating pressure as the resulting dry steam is much hotter than needed to stay in the vaporous state it will not contain any significant unevaporated water also higher steam pressure will be possible than with saturated steam enabling the steam to carry more energy although superheating adds more energy to the steam in the form of heat there is no effect on pressure which is determined by the rate at which steam is drawn from the boiler and the pressure settings of the safety valves the fuel consumption required to generate superheated steam is greater than that required to generate an equivalent volume of saturated steam however the overall energy efficiency of the steam plant the combination of boiler superheater piping and machinery generally will be improved enough to more than offset the increased fuel consumption superheater operation is similar to that of the coils on an air conditioning unit although for a different purpose the steam piping is directed through the flue gas path in the boiler furnace an area in which the temperature is typically between and degrees celsius and degrees fahrenheit some superheaters are radiant type which as the name suggests they absorb heat by radiation others are convection type absorbing heat from a fluid some are a combination of the two types through either method the extreme heat in the flue gas path will also heat the superheater steam piping and the steam within the design of any superheated steam plant presents several engineering challenges due to the high working temperatures and pressures one consideration is the introduction of feedwater to the boiler the pump used to charge the boiler must be able to overcome the boilers operating pressure else water will not flow as a superheated boiler is usually operated at high pressure the corresponding feedwater pressure must be even higher demanding a more robust pump design another consideration is safety high pressure superheated steam can be extremely dangerous if it unintentionally escapes to give the reader some perspective the steam plants used in many us navy destroyers built during world war ii operated at psi kpa bar pressure and degrees fahrenheit degrees celsius superheat in the event of a major rupture of the system an everpresent hazard in a warship during combat the enormous energy release of escaping superheated steam expanding to more than times its confined volume would be equivalent to a cataclysmic explosion whose effects would be exacerbated by the steam release occurring in a confined space such as a ships engine room also small leaks that are not visible at the point of leakage could be lethal if an individual were to step into the escaping steams path hence designers endeavor to give the steamhandling components of the system as much strength as possible to maintain integrity special methods of coupling steam pipes together are used to prevent leaks with very high pressure systems employing welded joints to avoided leakage problems with threaded or gasketed connections supercritical steam generator supercritical steam generators are frequently used for the production of electric power they operate at supercritical pressure in contrast to a subcritical boiler a supercritical steam generator operates at such a high pressure over psi or mpa that the physical turbulence that characterizes boiling ceases to occur the fluid is neither liquid nor gas but a supercritical fluid there is no generation of steam bubbles within the water because the pressure is above the critical pressure point at which steam bubbles can form as the fluid expands through the turbine stages its thermodynamic state drops below the critical point as it does work turning the turbine which turns the electrical generator from which power is ultimately extracted the fluid at that point may be a mix of steam and liquid droplets as it passes into the condenser this results in slightly less fuel use and therefore less greenhouse gas production the term boiler should not be used for a supercritical pressure steam generator as no boiling occurs in this device accessories boiler fittings and accessories pressuretrols to control the steam pressure in the boiler boilers generally have or pressuretrols a manualreset pressuretrol which functions as a safety by setting the upper limit of steam pressure the operating pressuretrol which controls when the boiler fires to maintain pressure and for boilers equipped with a modulating burner a modulating pressuretrol which controls the amount of fire safety valve it is used to relieve pressure and prevent possible explosion of a boiler water level indicators they show the operator the level of fluid in the boiler also known as a sight glass water gauge or water column bottom blowdown valves they provide a means for removing solid particulates that condense and lie on the bottom of a boiler as the name implies this valve is usually located directly on the bottom of the boiler and is occasionally opened to use the pressure in the boiler to push these particulates out continuous blowdown valve this allows a small quantity of water to escape continuously its purpose is to prevent the water in the boiler becoming saturated with dissolved salts saturation would lead to foaming and cause water droplets to be carried over with the steam a condition known as priming blowdown is also often used to monitor the chemistry of the boiler water trycock a type of valve that is often used to manually check a liquid level in a tank most commonly found on a water boiler flash tank highpressure blowdown enters this vessel where the steam can flash safely and be used in a lowpressure system or be vented to atmosphere while the ambient pressure blowdown flows to drain automatic blowdowncontinuous heat recovery system this system allows the boiler to blowdown only when makeup water is flowing to the boiler thereby transferring the maximum amount of heat possible from the blowdown to the makeup water no flash tank is generally needed as the blowdown discharged is close to the temperature of the makeup water hand holes they are steel plates installed in openings in header to allow for inspections installation of tubes and inspection of internal surfaces steam drum internals a series of screen scrubber cans cyclone separators lowwater cutoff it is a mechanical means usually a float switch or an electrode with a safety switch that is used to turn off the burner or shut off fuel to the boiler to prevent it from running once the water goes below a certain point if a boiler is dryfired burned without water in it it can cause rupture or catastrophic failure surface blowdown line it provides a means for removing foam or other lightweight noncondensible substances that tend to float on top of the water inside the boiler circulating pump it is designed to circulate water back to the boiler after it has expelled some of its heat feedwater check valve or clack valve a nonreturn stop valve in the feedwater line this may be fitted to the side of the boiler just below the water level or to the top of the boiler top feed in this design for feedwater injection the water is fed to the top of the boiler this can reduce boiler fatigue caused by thermal stress by spraying the feedwater over a series of trays the water is quickly heated and this can reduce limescale desuperheater tubes or bundles a series of tubes or bundles of tubes in the water drum or the steam drum designed to cool superheated steam in order to supply auxiliary equipment that does not need or may be damaged by dry steam chemical injection line a connection to add chemicals for controlling feedwater ph steam accessories main steam stop valve steam traps main steam stopcheck valve it is used on multiple boiler installations combustion accessories fuel oil

plate draught a fuelheated boiler must provide air to oxidize its fuel early boilers provided this stream of air or draught through the natural action of convection in a chimney connected to the exhaust of the combustion chamber since the heated flue gas is less dense than the ambient air surrounding the boiler the flue gas rises in the chimney pulling denser fresh air into the combustion chambermost modern boilers depend on mechanical draught rather than natural draught this is because natural draught is subject to outside air conditions and temperature of flue gases leaving the furnace as well as the chimney height all these factors make proper draught hard to attain and therefore make mechanical draught equipment much more reliable and economicaltypes of draught can also be divided into induced draught where exhaust gases are pulled out of the boiler forced draught where fresh air is pushed into the boiler and balanced draught where both effects are employed natural draught through the use of a chimney is a type of induced draught mechanical draught can be induced forced or balanced there are two types of mechanical induced draught the first is through use of a steam jet the steam jet oriented in the direction of flue gas flow induces flue gases into the stack and allows for a greater flue gas velocity increasing the overall draught in the furnace this method was common on steam driven locomotives which could not have tall chimneys the second method is by simply using an induced draught fan id fan which removes flue gases from the furnace and forces the exhaust gas up the stack almost all induced draught furnaces operate with a slightly negative pressure mechanical forced draught is provided by means of a fan forcing air into the combustion chamber air is often passed through an air heater which as the name suggests heats the air going into the furnace in order to increase the overall efficiency of the boiler dampers are used to control the quantity of air admitted to the furnace forced draught furnaces usually have a positive pressure balanced draught is obtained through use of both induced and forced draught this is more common with larger boilers where the flue gases have to travel a long distance through many boiler passes the induced draught fan works in conjunction with the forced draught fan allowing the furnace
